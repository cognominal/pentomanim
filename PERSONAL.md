# Pentominoes solver are my hello worlds

When I learn a new language, environment,
I do a [pentomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentomino) solver.
Too bad I did not save them.

Currently I am learning [manim](https://www.manim.community/) and the just released
(as of february 2026) [codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Codex) gui. Aliso starting
with [OpenClaw](<https://openclaw.ai/>.
I started by codex coding a manim app so the name
of the repo `pentomanim` which is a pun on `pentomino`.
Then I decided to to do the svelte app.
It took me about a day and a half to do both.
It will take me more to learn from the generated code.
Probably the svelte app will evolve but my focus is my lush project
that is in a bootstrapping stage.

Also in the repo is the folder `obfu/`. In the third annual Perl journal obfuscation
contest, I won in the creative category. This is my entry.
I  don't even know if it runs on
modern terminals.
